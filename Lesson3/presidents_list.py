# How can we use loops to reduce the necessary code that does the following
presidents = ['Washington','Adams','Jefferson']

print(f"{presidents[0]} was president #1")
print(f"{presidents[1]} was president #2")
print(f"{presidents[2]} was president #3")

# How do you get the index (the number between square brackets [])?
# What happens if we add a president to the list? What happens if we remove a president from the list?
